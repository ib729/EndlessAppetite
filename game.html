        <p>You are Bob, a 15-year-old student who just had another rough day at school. Your arm is bruised from being shoved into lockers, and your eyes are still wet from holding back tears. The bullies' words echo in your head: "Hey fatty, did you eat the entire cafeteria again?"</p>
        <br>
        <p>As you walk down the familiar street, the warm, inviting glow of 'The Nickado' appears ahead. The neon sign flickers with a strange green light, and the scent of perfectly cooked food wafts through the air.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What do you do?</p>
        <br>
        <p>1. Walk straight to The Nickado</p>
        <p>2. Stop and count how many times you've been there</p>
        <p>3. Try to go home instead</p>
